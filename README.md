## Description

This is a homepage that a user may set for their browser!  It will display a greeting with their name, as well as the current time and an area for Weekly events!  Within the greeting, there will be an option to open up and modify your to-do list! If the user has an OpenWeather API key, they may also add this to it so that the current weather will display!

## Usage

![usage1](./assets/images/readme-screenshot-2.png)

‚≠êWhen you first start this site, you will be asked for your Name, City, and OpenWeather API Key (if applicable).  The City currently will only be used for OpenWeather, so if you do not have a key, you may leave this section blank at this time as well.<br>
‚≠êOnce your homepage opens up, you will see a greeting based on the time of day, the time, weather (if applicable), and an area to write notes for the week.<br>
‚≠êAfter you write in some information in the Weekly Events, you will be able to save it by using the save button in this same box.<br>
‚≠êClicking on the clipboard icon in the greeting will open up your to-do list.  You will be able to add/remove to-do list items.  Once you finish modifying your to-do list, click on the "Save Changes" button for it to update.  If you do not want to save your changes or have no changes to add, you may click on the "Close" button instead.<br>
