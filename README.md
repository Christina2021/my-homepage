## Description

This is a homepage that a user may set for their browser!  It will display a greeting with their name, as well as the current time and an area for Weekly events/notes!  If the user has an OpenWeather API key, they may also add this to it so that the current weather will display!

‚≠êWhen you first start this site, you will be asked for your Name, City, and OpenWeather API Key (if applicable).  The City currently will only be used for OpenWeather, so if you do not have a key, you may leave this section blank at this time as well.<br>
‚≠êOnce your homepage opens up, you will see a greeting based on the time of day, the time, weather (if applicable), and an area to write notes for the week.<br>
‚≠êAfter you write in some information in the Weekly Events and To-Do's, you will be able to save it by using the save button in this same box.

#### Notes on Usage

‚≠êIf you need to change any information from the start page, you will be able to do so using the settings button in the top-right hand corner of the page.<br>
‚≠êNotes do not automatically save, so make sure to click on the save button!
